# Examples

Several real-world usage scenarios are available in the [`example/src/app` folder](./../../example/src/app).
You can explore them in two ways:

- **Browse the source code** to understand how each feature is implemented.
- **Run the examples as an Expo app** to interact with them directly.

```sh
cd example
npm install
npx expo start
```

** TODO insert app glossary menu screenshots **
